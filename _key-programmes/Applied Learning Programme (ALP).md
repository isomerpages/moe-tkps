#### Vision:

Resilient innovators

#### Mission:

To nurture entrepreneurship, critical and creative thinking in students

#### Department Approach

The school embarks on its ALP, D.R.I.VE.- Developing Resilient, Innovative Entrepreneurs in 2021. Through the school wide programme from Primary 1 to 6, students are provided with opportunities to develop the necessary skills and interest in the well-rounded curriculum. Design Thinking (DT) is used in our ALP to foster the value of empathy and our students learn to design creative solutions to resolve real life problems. Through the DT process, our students develop and apply the values and life skills learnt in authentic contexts.

  

The students will be developed through a 3-tiered structure – Explore, Experience and Expertize.

**<u>Tier 1: Explore</u>**

All students will be equipped with the 5 stages of DT knowledge and certain skills relevant to DT are emphasized in different levels during P1 to P6 VIA and Project Work. Through the progressive approach, students are given opportunities to apply their DT knowledge and skills in problem based activities and acquire dispositions that encourage the development of 21CC.

**<u>Tier 2: Experience</u>**

All students will deepen understanding of Design Thinking (DT) knowledge and skills as well as strengthen dispositions through IP and Non-IP level programmes. They are given opportunities to apply them in authentic contexts.  DT is incorporated in teaching and learning through the level programmes.

**<u>Tier 3: Expertize</u>**

Selected students who held leadership appointments (e.g., Student Leaders, NE Ambassadors and Green Monitors) will apply DT knowledge and skills in real life through partnership with external organisations.

#### Key Event

**Innovation Fair**

  

At the end of each year, an Innovation Fair is organised to showcase the innovative work and projects created by the students. This includes prototypes developed during P3 to P5 Science Innovation Programme, useful products which incorporated Math Coding, creative slogans and posters designed during MT Fortnight, music and art pieces produced during Digital Music and Digital Art respectively and selected PW/VIA projects that would be adopted by the school to solve real life problems. All students can learn from the displayed work and projects as well as be inspired by the creativity and brilliant ideas generated by their peers across the different disciplines. They can join in the fun and participate in the games created by students during Math Games and Grammar Games too.

  

Showcasing P6 VIA innovative products and advertisements online.
