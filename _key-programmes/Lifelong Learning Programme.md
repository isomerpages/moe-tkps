Lifelong Learning Program in schools was started in 2015. The aim of this initiative is to encourage the schools to promote their areas of strength through pervasive programmes. In Tanjong Katong Primary, we believe in the importance of values inculcation through Sports. In particular, through involvement in Team Sports, the following objectives are achieved.

1.  Passion for life – long participation in physical activity;
2.  Joyful sense of camaraderie in teams/groups; and
3.  Spirit of positivity through perseverance and resilience in overcoming challenges.

  

These outcomes are aligned to our school’s vision of developing Passionate Learners, Caring Leaders and Global Citizens. By tapping on the school’s success in Football, Netball, Hockey and Floorball, opportunities are created for the students to

*   Participate in intra-class, interclass and inter-level team sports;
*   Increase their understanding of Sports through exposure and learning of various Sports popular in Singapore;
*   Appreciate the Olympics Values of Friendship, Respect and Excellence through active participation in sports.

We hope that students will be empowered by their participation in Team Sports and grow to become passion leaders, caring leaders and global citizens of the community.
