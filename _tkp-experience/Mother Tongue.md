The pictorial framework represents the philosophy of teaching of the Mother Tongue languages in Tanjong Katong Primary.  

  

The heart represents the love and passion in learning the Mother Tongue language, which includes culture, values and attitude. In order to develop this love and passion to achieve the MT vision and mission, students need to be immersed in a conducive learning environment. The purple house frame depicts the desired learning environment which is enriching, fun and supportive.

  

To achieve this, both parents and teachers need to work together hand in hand.
