Tongue languages in Tanjong Katong Primary.</p>
<p>The heart represents the love and passion in learning the Mother Tongue
language, which includes culture, values and attitude. In order to develop

our Chinese Culture through a 2-day Cultural Immersion Programme. Pupils
will get to visit the "Chinatown Heritage Centre", "Thian Hock Keng Temple"

also be introduced to Teochew Opera, Traditional Chinese Medicine, famous
