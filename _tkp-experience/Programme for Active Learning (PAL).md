<h4>Department Approach</h4>
<h5>What is PAL?</h5>
<p>The Programme for Active Learning (PAL) is a MOE recommendation that started
since 2009. PAL aims to provide a greater emphasis in non-academic programmes
for all Primary 1 and 2 students, through the exposure to varied and fun
learning experiences in the four domains: Sports and Games, Outdoor Education,
Performing Arts and Visual Arts. Students also learn socio-emotional competencies
such as respecting others and responsible decision making. PAL nurtures
confidence, curiosity and cooperation skills in students.</p>
<p>PAL lessons are also time for students and teachers to foster deeper Teacher-Students
Relations (TSR). This is done so through the effective facilitation on
sharing of feelings and discussions on Self-awareness, Relationship-Management.</p>
<p>In order to attain the desired outcomes of PAL, PAL lessons are designed
with the following characteristics:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Experiential</p>

<li>
<p>Fun and enjoyable</p>

</li>
