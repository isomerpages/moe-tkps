<h5 style="color:black">What is PAL?</h5>

The Programme for Active Learning (PAL) is a MOE recommendation that started since 2009. PAL aims to provide a greater emphasis in non-academic programmes for all Primary 1 and 2 students, through the exposure to varied and fun learning experiences in the four domains: Sports and Games, Outdoor Education, Performing Arts and Visual Arts. Students also learn socio-emotional competencies such as respecting others and responsible decision making. PAL nurtures confidence, curiosity and cooperation skills in students.

  

PAL lessons are also time for students and teachers to foster deeper Teacher-Students Relations (TSR). This is done so through the effective facilitation on sharing of feelings and discussions on Self-awareness, Relationship-Management.

  

In order to attain the desired outcomes of PAL, PAL lessons are designed with the following characteristics:

*   Experiential
*   Fun and enjoyable
*   Encompass learning in a creative way
*   Provide opportunities for children to create
*   Incorporate values education and social emotional learning
