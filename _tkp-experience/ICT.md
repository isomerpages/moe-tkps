<h4>Key Programmes / Activities / Events</h4>
<h5>MOE ICT Curriculum Framework</h5>
<p>In Tanjong Katong Primary School, we believe all students and staff play
an active role in their individual learning with the seamless use of ICT
skills and technology.</p>
<p>With sound values, we strongly believe that they can excel in their educational
and self-development in an ICT enriched learning environment.</p>
<p>We hope to provide opportunities for our students to be joyful and responsible
digital learners through a range of quality learning experiences with technology.</p>
<p>Our school’s ICT literacy programme is built on MOE’s standards of new
media literacy and includes the skills, knowledge, attitudes and values
that students should apply and demonstrate when harnessing ICT for learning
and interacting. The new ICT baseline standards are: curating digital content;
connecting and communicating digitally; and creating digital multimodal
products.</p>

<h5>Department’s ICT Strategy</h5>
<p>With the introduction of the Student Learning Space (SLS), learning with
technology in Tanjong Katong Primary School is guided by the SLS Pedagogical
Scaffold which enables teachers to design technology-enabled learning experiences
to enhance students’ learning.</p>
<p>In designing learning with technology, teachers consider the following
student-centric active learning process while planning a technology-enabled
lesson:</p>
<p><strong><u>Activate Learning</u></strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>How will students’ focus and interest be oriented towards the learning
objectives?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Promote Thinking and Discussion</u></strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>How will students think about ideas and concepts?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What skills and processes will students perform?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How will students build on their current understanding?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Facilitate Demonstration of Learning</u></strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>How will students demonstrate their understanding and new learning?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Monitor and Provide Feedback</u></strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>How can students’ learning be advanced?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h5>Tanjong Katong Primary School’s IT Roadmap</h5>
