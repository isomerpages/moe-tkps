<p><strong>A community of critical thinkers and Innovative problem solvers.</strong>
</p>
<h4>Department Mission</h4>
<p>To provide quality and varied Mathematics programmes to engage the students
in the learning of Mathematics for real-life application.</p>
<h4>Department Approach</h4>
<p>The learning of Mathematics in TKP is based on the Singapore Mathematics
Curriculum Framework and the three phases of learning-Readiness, Engagement
and Mastery. Instructional lessons are conducted using the Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract
Approach by providing our students with opportunities to handle concrete
manipulatives and solve word problems using the “RIGHT√” strategy. Teachers
make use of Thinking routines and Maths Talk in classroom discussion in
the inquiry-based learning of Mathematics concepts and&nbsp;skills.</p>

<h4>Key Programmes / Activities / Events</h4>
<h5>Learn for Life</h5>
<p>In TKP, we believe in creating opportunities for our students to develop
key competencies that are important in the 21st century through Games and
Coding.</p>
<h5>Embrace all Learners</h5>
<p>We believe that all our students can learn Mathematics and we need to
provide differentiated support to cater to the different abilities of our
students.</p>
<p><strong><u>Learning Support for Mathematics (LSM)</u></strong>
</p>
<p>The P1 and P2 LSM programmes are early intervention programme to help
our lower primary students attain their relevant Mathematics age. The lessons
are conducted by trained LSM teachers using MOE developed LSM lesson packages.</p>
<p><strong><u>E2K (Maths) and Olympiad Programme</u></strong>
</p>
<p>For our high-abilities students, we have the E2K (Maths) and Olympiad
training to further develop their interest and abilities in more advanced
Mathematics concepts. The E2K (Maths) Programme are conducted by our trained
school teachers while the Olympiad Programme are conducted by external
