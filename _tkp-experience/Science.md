<h4>Department Mission</h4>
<p>To provide a learning environment where students are exposed to experiences
that stimulate their curiosity and interest as well as to develop skills
and attitudes for scientific inquiry.</p>
<h4>Department Approach</h4>
<p>To make&nbsp;<strong>instructional</strong>&nbsp;lessons more authentic,
hands-on learning activities are situated in realistic contexts so that
students can make connections with their own lives and their environment.
Students study the nature at work at the Science garden, and Science Centre.
Science Literature reading in class develops studentsâ€™ interest in Science
related issues and topics, as well as understand that Science is part of
everyday life.</p>
<p>Through the&nbsp;<strong>Interactive</strong>&nbsp;learning platforms
such as group work and Google platform, opportunities for collaborative
learning are provided for student to work together during experiments and
Science Innovation Programme which uses the Design Thinking Framework.</p>
<p><strong>Inquiry</strong>-based Learning that involves the use of 5E Approach,
MTV routines, Sci Talk and answering techniques like LINK, CER, OIC and
FIR during Science lessons help to develop independent and critical thinking
in our students.</p>
<h4>Key Programmes / Activities / Events</h4>
<h5>Learn for Life</h5>
<p>Through the P3 to P5 Science Innovation Programme, students will apply
their scientific knowledge, process skills and use Design Thinking to take
part in the scientific process of problem solving, investigation and decision-making.</p>
