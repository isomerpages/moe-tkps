#### Department Mission

To provide a learning environment where students are exposed to experiences that stimulate their curiosity and interest as well as to develop skills and attitudes for scientific inquiry.

#### Department Approach

To make **instructional** lessons more authentic, hands-on learning activities are situated in realistic contexts so that students can make connections with their own lives and their environment. Students study the nature at work at the Science garden, and Science Centre. Science Literature reading in class develops students’ interest in Science related issues and topics, as well as understand that Science is part of everyday life.

  

Through the **Interactive** learning platforms such as group work and Google platform, opportunities for collaborative learning are provided for student to work together during experiments and Science Innovation Programme which uses the Design Thinking Framework.

  

**Inquiry**\-based Learning that involves the use of 5E Approach, MTV routines, Sci Talk and answering techniques like LINK, CER, OIC and FIR during Science lessons help to develop independent and critical thinking in our students.

#### Key Programmes / Activities / Events

##### Learn for Life

Through the P3 to P5 Science Innovation Programme, students will apply their scientific knowledge, process skills and use Design Thinking to take part in the scientific process of problem solving, investigation and decision-making.
