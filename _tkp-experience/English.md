<h4>Department Vision</h4>
<p><strong>Effective &amp; Affective Communicators</strong> 
<br><strong>Confident Users of the English language</strong>
</p>
<h4>Department Mission</h4>
<p>To provide an engaging learning environment that promotes creative inquiry
and critical thinking and develops students into discerning, respectful
and competent users of the English language.</p>
<h4>Department Approach</h4>
<p>At TKP, we aim to equip students with a strong foundation in reading,
writing, speaking, listening, viewing &amp; representing skills for effective
communication and provide an enjoyable language learning experience through
explicit instruction and communicative approach to language development.
Guided by the English Language Syllabus 2010 &amp; 2020 (MOE, Singapore),
we also incorporate experiential and interactive and inquiry-based learning
into both STELLAR/STELLAR 2.0, the national English Language (EL) curriculum,
and our school-based curriculum (SBC) that incorporate character and citizenship
education and 21st century competencies through various visible thinking
routines and inquiry-based strategies.</p>
<h4>Key Programmes / Activities / Events</h4>
<h5>Learn For Life</h5>
<p>We infuse character and citizenship education in our EL curriculum to
instil values and develop a global outlook among our students and incorporate
digital learning in our the curriculum to cultivate digital literacy in
our students through:</p>
<p><strong><u>Newspaper-based EL lessons</u></strong>
</p>
<p>The P5 and P6 students subscribe to the What’s Up, a newspaper for children,
which is used in the teaching of language components such as reading comprehension,
reinforcement of grammar and vocabulary building.</p>
<p>Students are also taught to discuss and respond to the current affairs
in the various articles Reading Journal and Writer’s Notebook for greater
appreciation of contemporary issues.</p>

</div>
<p><strong><u>Project-based ICT-EL lessons</u></strong>
</p>
<p>To equip our students with the relevant 21st century competencies, we
integrate information and communication technology (ICT) into our EL curriculum
through the various level-specific project-based lessons such as touch-typing,
MS Office, digital storytelling, podcast and video-editing.</p>
<p>Other digital resources such as web-based texts (e.g. online articles,
blogs, wikis) and online learning sites are also used to facilitate teaching
and provide close-to-real experiences in making learning more meaningful
and authentic.</p>
<p>Using ICT to drive e-Pedagogy in our English lessons also enables students
to be curious, apply understanding and assess their learning in creative
ways.</p>

</div>
<p><strong><u>Explicit Teaching of Comprehension Skills using Children’s Literature</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Our students are also explicitly taught on how to make inferences and
summarise the gist of the texts they read using authentic children’s literature.
Teachers model and scaffold the thinking process in inferring and summarising
using inquiry-based strategies such as surface and deep annotation strategies
as well as visible thinking routines and various talk moves in the English
classroom.</p>
<p>This encourages students to be active, engaged, discerning and strategic
readers who will be able to make better sense of their reading.</p>
<p><strong><u>Assessment</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Guided by the principles of Assessment OF Learning (AoL) and Assessment
FOR Learning (AfL), we monitor students’ learning through a wide range
of assessment modes, which are used to provide feedback to facilitate future
learning (formative) and to ascertain students’ level of language competency
at that point in time (summative). The various modes of assessment include:</p>
<p>a. Performance-based assessment such as show-and-tell, speech &amp; drama,
reading aloud and stimulus-based conversation.
<br>b. Bite-size formative assessment
<br>c. Pen-and-paper assessment which includes bite-size weighted assessment,
the mid-year &amp; year-end summative assessments.</p>
<h5>Embrace all Learners</h5>
<p>We recognise and develop students’ talents in the English language by
providing them the platform to showcase their abilities. We also provide
differentiated support necessary both to level up and stretch our students
to the best of their potential.</p>
<p><strong><u>P1 &amp; P2 Speech &amp; Drama Programme</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Our speech and drama programme for P1 and P2 students is designed to develop
our students into proficient and confident speakers of English through
fun and engaging activities and provide a platform for our young learners
to showcase their oral communication skills at the end of their learning
through a class performance to an audience. Conducted during the English
classes for a term, this programme enables the students to acquire speech
and drama skills such as voice projection, articulation and spatial awareness
through play, games and mini group performances. Our students are provided
with formative feedback to help them develop their self-confidence, communication
and presentation skills.&nbsp; We also hope our students will develop the
love of learning EL from this programme.</p>

<p><strong><u>Learning Support Programme (LSP), Reading Remediation Programme (RRP) &amp; School-based Dyslexia Remediation (SDR)</u></strong>
</p>
<p>The LSP (P1 &amp; P2), RRP (P3 &amp; P4) and SDR (P3 &amp; P4) are literacy
support programmes that cater to the needs of struggling readers who are
given additional support in reading to keep up with the standard EL curriculum
better. The lessons are conducted by trained Learning Support Coordinators
(LSC), RRP and SDR teacher-instructors who provide the necessary remediation
in reading through a comprehensive teaching package and guidelines developed
by the Reading Unit of EL Curriculum Planning and Development Division.</p>
<p><strong><u>High-Ability (HA) Programme</u></strong>
</p>
<p>To provide an opportunity for our high-ability students to optimise their
potential in the learning of the English language beyond the classroom,
the following series of enrichment modules are conducted for the high-ability
students in the various levels:</p>
<p>i. Young Journalism module (Primary 4)
<br>ii. Writing Enrichment Programme (Primary 5 &amp; 6)</p>

<h5>Drama In Education</h5>
<p>Experiential Learning P1 &amp; P2 Learning Journey Enchanted by the Elephant
Show STELLAR lessons Group Writing during MLEA (2) Drama In Education In
TKP, we believe that drama is a fun, learner-centred and non-threatening
approach which encourages students to be active, imaginative, collaborative
and interactive. It supports the four blocks of literacy development in
listening, speaking, reading and writing. It also offers a wide spectrum
of possibilities and is accessible to all levels of language proficiency
as there are varieties of non-verbal and verbal roles that students can
choose to participate in. Dramatisation builds fluency and enhances oral
language development through repeated rereading and boost confidence in
learners.</p>
<p>Considering our students’ strength in oral communication, we strive to
provide platforms to uncover the joy in learning through different drama
strategies to enhance idea generation for writing and reading comprehension
in the lower and middle primary EL classroom. As a pre-writing tool, students
explore different perspectives and viewpoints and learn either through
acting out of a scene or through observing their classmates’ dramatisation
of it. In reading comprehension, students get to explore, interact and
engage with the texts that they read. These will increase their interest
and comprehension of the text read.</p>
