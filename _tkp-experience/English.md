#### Department Mission

To provide an engaging learning environment that promotes creative inquiry and critical thinking and develops students into discerning, respectful and competent users of the English language.

At TKP, we aim to equip students with a strong foundation in reading, writing, speaking, listening, viewing & representing skills for effective communication and provide an enjoyable language learning experience through explicit instruction and communicative approach to language development. Guided by the English Language Syllabus 2010 & 2020 (MOE, Singapore), we also incorporate experiential and interactive and inquiry-based learning into both STELLAR/STELLAR 2.0, the national English Language (EL) curriculum, and our school-based curriculum (SBC) that incorporate character and citizenship education and 21st century competencies through various visible thinking routines and inquiry-based strategies.

#### Key Programmes / Activities / Events

##### Learn For Life

We infuse character and citizenship education in our EL curriculum to instil values and develop a global outlook among our students and incorporate digital learning in our the curriculum to cultivate digital literacy in our students through:

**<u>Newspaper-based EL lessons</u>**

The P5 and P6 students subscribe to the What’s Up, a newspaper for children, which is used in the teaching of language components such as reading comprehension, reinforcement of grammar and vocabulary building. Students are also taught to discuss and respond to the current affairs in the various articles Reading Journal and Writer’s Notebook for greater appreciation of contemporary issues.

**<u>Project-based ICT-EL lessons</u>**

To equip our students with the relevant 21st century competencies, we integrate information and communication technology (ICT) into our EL curriculum through the various level-specific project-based lessons such as touch-typing, MS Office, digital storytelling, podcast and video-editing.

  

Other digital resources such as web-based texts (e.g. online articles, blogs, wikis) and online learning sites are also used to facilitate teaching and provide close-to-real experiences in making learning more meaningful and authentic.
