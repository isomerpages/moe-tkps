<h3>Key Programmes</h3>

<li>
<p><strong>National Education Commemorative Events</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Our commemorative days are linked to important points in Singapore’s history.</p>
<p><strong>a) Total Defence Day (15 February)</strong>
</p>
<p>During TDD, our pupils reflect on how Total Defence remains our best all-round
response to threats and challenges (e.g. terrorism, pandemics, cyber attacks
etc.) The TDD activities aim to encourage the pupils to play a greater
role in Total Defence by showing them what they can do to contribute in
big and small ways.</p>

<p><strong>b) International Friendship Day (in April)</strong>
</p>
<p>As a member of a global community of nations, we continue to leverage
on Singapore’s geo-strategic position for economic growth as well as social
and cultural cooperation, particularly with our ASEAN neighbours. Therefore,
our IFD programme is designed to develop a better understanding of the
people and cultures of countries in our region.</p>

<p><strong>c) Racial Harmony Day (21 July)</strong>
</p>
<p>RHD marks the anniversary of the 1964 racial riots. Our pupils commemorate
RHD to celebrate Singapore as a harmonious society built on a rich diversity
of cultures.</p>

<p><strong>d) National Day (9 August)</strong>
</p>
<p>National Day marks our separation from Malaysia in 1965, and our emergence
as an independent country in a community of nations. Each year, we commemorate
National Day by holding an observance ceremony for students to have a greater
sense of the historical importance and solemnity of National Day.</p>

<p><strong>Infusion of National Education / Contemporary Issues in Subjects</strong>

<p>While National Education is more commonly associated with Social Studies
English and Mother Tongue, the students discuss contemporary issues across

narrative.</p>
