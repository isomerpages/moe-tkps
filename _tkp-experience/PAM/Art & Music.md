<h4>Key Programs / Activities / Events</h4>
<h5><strong>Learn for Life</strong></h5>
<p>Character and Citizenship education is infused in our Aesthetics curriculum,
especially when students are taught about global and local cultures. The
learning of local artworks and artists strengthens the understanding of
the individual’s national identity by fostering the appreciation of one’s
cultural heritage. Music, being an integral part of many cultures, also
provides a means to raise global awareness amongst students. The art and
music classroom is a natural platform to nurture core values, develop social
and emotional competencies, as well as many 21st Century Competencies,
which will better prepare our students to thrive in a fast-changing and
highly-connected world.</p>
<p><strong><u>Museum-based Learning</u></strong> 
<br>The trip aims to provide students with an authentic learning experience.
Students will be engaged in activities and discussions focussing on visual
inquiry skills and art appreciation of local and international artists.</p>

<p><strong><u>Digital Art and Music</u></strong> 
<br>To provide students with a holistic experience in the learning of Art,
students will be introduced to harnessing technology to create art. They
will use Photoshop as a tool to create posters and in the process, acquire
skills to crop, fill and merge images together digitally. During music
lessons, students will also be introduced to the know-hows of GarageBand
and use smart instruments to create originals.</p>

<p><strong><u>Assessment</u></strong> 
<br>Assessment is integral to the teaching and learning process. Art and Music
assessments take on a formative role and are carried out regularly to provide
students with information about their strengths and to help them bridge
learning gaps. Students submit termly art pieces for feedback. Music assessments
take on a variety of ways such as aural, theory and practical formats.</p>
<h5>Embrace all Learners</h5>
<p>We believe that all children are musical and have the innate ability to
listen, sing, dance, play and express themselves musically. We recognise
students’ talents in the Arts by providing platforms to showcase their
abilities.</p>
<p><strong><u>TK Spotlight!</u></strong> 
<br>This event is held annually to develop excellence in the Aesthetics as
well as to promote the appreciation of the Arts amongst students. Students
pit their talents against each other in categories such as Art, Instrumental,
Pop Voice and Dance.</p>

<p><strong><u>TK Buskers</u></strong> 
<br>With this opportunity to showcase their interests and talents in the Arts
in a non-threatening and casual manner, students put up performances for
their peers during recesses.</p>

<p><strong><u>National Day Banner</u></strong> 
<br>In a bid to spread good cheer and national spirit in the community, students
design banners with the year’s National Day theme in mind. Selected banners
are hung around the neighbourhood in the days leading up to our nation’s
birthday.</p>

<h5>Enhance student well-being</h5>
<p>The Aesthetics have the ability to develop extra-musical skills, including
critical thinking skills, psychomotor skills, social awareness, and moral
and cultural values, all of which contribute to the holistic development
of a child.</p>
