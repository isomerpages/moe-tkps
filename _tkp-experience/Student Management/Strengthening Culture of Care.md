</p>
<p>1 . UPBEAT</p>
<p>This is a 3-day programme set aside on the first 3 days of the school
year for form teachers and subject teachers to bond with their students.
Besides bonding, teachers get to know their students, set a positive tone
for the year, inculcate school values and help their students to settle
down in school.</p>

expectations and routines;

involved in decision-making, regard mistakes as learning opportunities,
and express their views confidently.</p>

<h4>Peer Support and Relationships (PSR)</h4>
<p><u>Tier 1</u>
<br>The mind-set that all of us can show care to one another is cultivated.
Explicit teaching of social and emotional competencies in CCE or FTGP curriculum
to build resilience is done during our Home Period.</p>
<p>Each student is equipped with basic Peer Helping Skills such as Seeking
Help and Giving Help.</p>

for learning and skill development. Our Primary 1 students especially enjoy
the one-to-one attention they receive from their Primary 4 buddies.</p>

<h4>Guiding Beliefs</h4>
<p><strong>Take Care Of Yourself</strong> 
<br>In ensuring personal safety and responsibilities, we hope our students
to learn how to use various strategies taught, and implement them in a
regular routine so that they can boost their well-being.</p>
<p><strong>Take Care Of Others</strong> 
<br>Providing a listening ear, noticing when someone needs help, and helping
our community without seeking anything in return. This also entails being
kind to others in words and actions, and being useful to the community.</p>
<p><strong>Take Care Of Your Surroundings</strong> 
<br>Being aware of one’s environmental footprint to see how much impact just
one person has one the world’s resources, and adjust accordingly. In addition,
be cognizant of the immediate environment by keeping it clean and take
personal responsibility for it.</p>
