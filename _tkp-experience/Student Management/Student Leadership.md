#### Overview

TK believes in giving every student an opportunity to be a leader.  No one is born with all the essential leadership qualities. Learning and developing good leadership skills in a safe environment as a student leader would serve our students well when they leave our learning environment and step into the society.

As part of holistic education, at TK, leadership opportunities for our students are guided by our school’s vision of ‘Passionate Learners, Caring Leaders, Global Citizens’ and the school values of Perseverance, Respect, Responsibility, Integrity, Discipline and Empathy.    
  
The school has put in place a leadership structure to develop the leadership competencies of our student leaders through three levels of leadership dimensions of Lead Self, Lead Peers and Lead Teams and the Community.

#### 3-Tier Structure

<img src="/images/Picture1.png" style="width:70%">

The Student Leadership structure in TK is 3-tiered and the first tier refers to the Class Leaders. In this tier, students take up class leadership positions where they focus on ‘Self Leadership’. TK strongly believes that every student should be developed to be a leader and therefore such Student Leadership Development is made intentional in TK. By the end of their Primary school education, students would have achieved at least one tier of the student leadership structure.

Students are trained to equip them with the necessary technical skills and values to prepare them for their duties and responsibilities. These training sessions also include case studies where the students analyze the situations, share their thoughts and learn from one another. Following the training, various platforms are provided for the class leaders to practice their leadership skills. The Class Leadership Chart is displayed in the classroom. This is to highlight the importance of the class leaders’ roles and to empower them to perform their duties with diligence and confidence.

Our school uses a whole school approach in providing students with broad experiences that develop leadership skills and qualities in them to care, lead and inspire by continually conducting trainings at each level.

#### Equip and Practice with TK Leadership Practices

We aim to nurture Every Child A Leader through the 4 TK Leadership Practices which we have adapted from the 5 Exemplary Leadership Practices by Kouzes and Posner to undergird their Leadership Journey.  
  
The Student Leadership programmes are intentionally planned with the two tenets of ‘Equip’ and ‘Practice’ in mind. All students undergo leadership training lessons to nurture the leadership potential of our student to its fullest.   
  
The learning materials and activities aim to explicitly and implicitly impart leadership skills.

**Equip:**<br>
Training sessions are provided for the respective roles in order to equip them with the necessary technical skills and values to prepare them for their duties and responsibilities.

**Practice:**<br>
Platforms are provided for them in class, CCA, school events or beyond school for the students to exemplify their leadership skills. These platforms are planned intentionally for the various groups of student leaders in order for them to have opportunities to apply the skills learnt.

#### Student Leaders Council – Serve. Lead. Inspire

<img src="/images/Picture 4.png" style="width:40%">

At the end of P3, students will be nominated through the rating tools by their form teachers for Student Leaders Council selection. Nominated students will undergo a selection process by the Student Management Department teachers to be shortlisted as student leaders in P4.

<u>SLC- Service to the School</u>

Student Leaders contribute to the school by ensuring the safety and discipline of their peers. They are given the opportunities to help in school events and activities to showcase their leadership skills and in leading their peers.

<u>SLC- Service to the Community</u>

**Primary 4 and 5 SLC VIA Project**   

Our student leaders embark on VIA projects to further expand their leadership skills in leading and contributing to the Community.  

Building on our school’s Applied Learning Programme on Developing Resilient InnoVative Entrepreneurs, student leaders will apply Design Thinking framework into their VIA projects. Through these projects, they experience and learn the values R.E.S.P.E.C.T – Respect, Empathy, Sincerity, Patience, Ethical, Compassionate and Teamwork.   With the spirit of giving and empathy in mind, we hope our student leaders will continue to Serve, Lead and Inspire for years to come.

**Mentoring and Training**   

From Primary 4 to Primary 6, Student Leaders attend mentoring sessions and a variety of workshops. During the mentoring sessions, using the 4 TK Practices, student leaders are actively engaged with multi-modal learning materials that explore leadership values and traits. They collaboratively grapple with ethical and moral case studies and seek solutions to them. Students also undergo self-reflection to process and make meaning of the learning experiences.

Through the leadership workshops, we aim to nurture the leadership potential of our student leaders to their fullest. We hope to cultivate leaders who possess competent leadership traits, sound moral qualities and social responsibility. Additionally, student leaders are given opportunities to attend workshops to equip them with good public speaking and team building skills. By the end of primary school, student leaders emerge with an increased awareness and confidence required for their student leadership roles.
