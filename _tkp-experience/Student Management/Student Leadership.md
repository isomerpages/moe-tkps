**<u>Overview</u>**

  

TKP believes in giving every student an opportunity to be a leader. As part of our vision of ‘Passionate Learners, Caring Leaders, Global Citizens’, we aim to nurture ethical and effective leaders through two tenets of ‘Equip’ and ‘Practice’.

  

The school has put in place a leadership structure to develop the leadership competencies of our student leaders through three levels of leadership dimensions.

  

  

**<u>Mode of Training Student Leaders: Equip and Practice</u>**

  

The Student Leadership programmes are intentionally planned with the two tenets of ‘Equip’ and ‘Practice’ in mind.

  

**<u>Equip:</u>**

Every TKP student is given an opportunity to be a leader. School’s core values are incorporated into co-curricular programmes. Training sessions are provided for the respective roles in order to equip them with the necessary technical skills and values to prepare them for their duties and responsibilities.

  

**<u>Practice:</u>**

Platforms are provided for them in class, CCA, school events or beyond school for the students to exemplify their leadership skills. These platforms are planned intentionally for the various groups of student leaders in order for them to have opportunities to apply the skills learnt.

  

  

**<u>3-Tier Approach/ Structure</u>**

  

The Student Leadership structure in TKP is 3-tiered and the first tier refers to the Class Leaders. In this tier, students take up class leadership positions where they focus on ‘Self Leadership’. TKP strongly believes that every student should be developed to be a leader and therefore such Student Leadership Development is made intentional in TKP. By the end of their Primary school education, students would have achieved at least one tier of the student leadership structure.

Our key classroom roles include; Chairperson, Vice-Chairperson, National Education (NE) Ambassador, Green monitor, Information Technology (IT) monitor, Class Librarian, Cyberwellness Ambassador, Peer Support Representative, Subject Representatives and Group Leaders. The teachers identify these leaders in the beginning of the year and some roles are appointed on a rotational basis so as more students are given the opportunities to unleash their leadership skills.

  

Students are trained to equip them with the necessary technical skills and values to prepare them for their duties and responsibilities. These training sessions also include case studies where the students analyze the situations, share their thoughts and learn from one another. Following the training, various platforms are provided for the class leaders to practice their leadership skills. For example, our Class Monitors and NE Ambassadors lead the daily pledge taking which allows them to be good role models for their peers. The Class Leadership Chart is displayed in the classroom. This is to highlight the importance of the class leaders’ roles and to empower them to perform their duties with diligence and confidence.

  

Our school uses a whole school approach in providing students with broad experiences that develop leadership skills and qualities in them to care, lead and inspire by continually conducting trainings at each level.

  

  

**<u>SLC- Service to School</u>**

  

From Primary 4 to Primary 6, TKP Student Leaders attend one leadership-training module per year. By the end of primary school, the student leaders would have completed three leadership modules.

  

The leadership training modules aims to nurture the leadership potential of our student leaders to its fullest. It hopes to cultivate leaders who possess competent leadership traits, sound moral qualities and social responsibility. The modules are run in a group environment. The learning materials and activities aim to explicitly and implicitly impart leadership skills. Student leaders will be equipped with a fundamental understanding of the Five Practices of Exemplary Leadership Model.

  

The Student Leadership competencies that we instill in our student leaders are adapted from Jim Kouzes and Barry Posner’s 5 Practices of Exemplary Leadership:

  

a)    Model the Way – set examples for others to follow

b)    Inspire a Shared Vision – begins with the end in mind

c)    Challenge the process – seeks out opportunities to improve

d)    Enable others to act – synergise and seek to understand

e)    Encourage the heart – think win-win

  

They will actively engage with multi-modal learning materials that explore leadership values and traits. They collaboratively grapple with ethical and moral case studies and seek solutions to them. Students also undergo self-reflection to process and make meaning of the learning experiences from the modules.

  

By the end of the each module, student leaders emerge with an increased awareness and confidence required for their student leadership roles.

  

  

**SLC- Service to the Community**

  

**Primary 4 SLC VIA Project** <br>
**Collaboration with Willing Hearts**

  

Aligned with Willing Hearts’ vision to improve the lives _of the underprivileged and marginalised by providing them with their “daily bread” and to help them become useful members of our society_, our Primary 4 student leaders have embarked on several projects with the organisation.

  

One project involved the student leaders learning to make _samosas_ from scratch in the Willing Hearts kitchen. It was a meaningful time knowing that the food prepared from the heart would go into the provision of daily meals for others in need.

  

Through the interaction with other Willing Heart volunteers during our time there, our student leaders experienced and were also learnt the values R.E.S.P.E.C.T – Respect, Empathy, Sincerity, Patience, Ethical, Compassionate and Teamwork. Being a part of raising awareness and driving food donations for the community was indeed a fruitful learning journey for the student leaders.

  

  

**Primary 5 SLC VIA Project**

**Collaboration with APSN**

  

Our Primary 5 student leaders went through a series of design thinking lessons with the end goal of raising awareness of APSN. Design thinking was applied throughout the various site visits, brainstorming sessions and testing of products/ideas. The guidance from APSN personnel gave deep insights and direction to the alignment of the projects.

  

After the rigorous design thinking cycle and approval granted from the organisation, our student leaders raised awareness through the school’s FTGP lessons driven by meaningful classroom activities. There were recess booths set up with games, iPledge and exhibit of items made by APSN students to allow the mass participation of the school population in this VIA journey. The “Pay It Forward” movement at APSN’s Mystical Café where patrons are encouraged to buy a meal voucher given to the next stranger who might be less fortunate to have a free meal is also publicised in the school through the VIA project.

  

With the spirit of giving and empathy in mind, we hope our student leaders will continue to Serve, Lead and Inspire for years to come.

  

  

**CAMP A.C.E** (Adaptive, Compassionate and Empowering)

  

Camp A.C.E was designed and developed specifically for the leaders of Tanjong Katong Primary. The main aim of this camp is to develop our students from the Student Leaders Council as well as the different CCAs into holistic leaders in their respective areas, instilled with all the necessary qualities to lead their peers effectively.

  

This 3 day, 2 night residential camp allows our student leaders to learn more about themselves through various carefully planned activities. Over the years, our students have had the opportunity to experience activities such as raft building, artificial caving, high elements and outdoor cooking. The highlight of the camp, however, has to be a trek which takes students across the Southern Ridges of Singapore. During this trek, students work together to complete various tasks and challenges.

  

Ultimately, as the name suggests, our main objective is to develop our students into leaders who are Adaptive, Compassionate and Empowering!
