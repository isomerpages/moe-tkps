#### Overview

TK believes in giving every student an opportunity to be a leader.  No one is born with all the essential leadership qualities. Learning and developing good leadership skills in a safe environment as a student leader would serve our students well when they leave our learning environment and step into the society.

As part of holistic education, at TK, leadership opportunities for our students are guided by our school’s vision of ‘Passionate Learners, Caring Leaders, Global Citizens’ and the school values of Perseverance, Respect, Responsibility, Integrity, Discipline and Empathy.    
  
The school has put in place a leadership structure to develop the leadership competencies of our student leaders through three levels of leadership dimensions of Lead Self, Lead Peers and Lead Teams and the Community.

#### 3-Tier Structure

The Student Leadership structure in TK is 3-tiered and the first tier refers to the Class Leaders. In this tier, students take up class leadership positions where they focus on ‘Self Leadership’. TK strongly believes that every student should be developed to be a leader and therefore such Student Leadership Development is made intentional in TK. By the end of their Primary school education, students would have achieved at least one tier of the student leadership structure.

Students are trained to equip them with the necessary technical skills and values to prepare them for their duties and responsibilities. These training sessions also include case studies where the students analyze the situations, share their thoughts and learn from one another. Following the training, various platforms are provided for the class leaders to practice their leadership skills. The Class Leadership Chart is displayed in the classroom. This is to highlight the importance of the class leaders’ roles and to empower them to perform their duties with diligence and confidence.

Our school uses a whole school approach in providing students with broad experiences that develop leadership skills and qualities in them to care, lead and inspire by continually conducting trainings at each level.

#### Equip and Practice with TK Leadership Practices

We aim to nurture Every Child A Leader through the 4 TK Leadership Practices which we have adapted from the 5 Exemplary Leadership Practices by Kouzes and Posner to undergird their Leadership Journey.  
  
The Student Leadership programmes are intentionally planned with the two tenets of ‘Equip’ and ‘Practice’ in mind. All students undergo leadership training lessons to nurture the leadership potential of our student to its fullest.   
  
The learning materials and activities aim to explicitly and implicitly impart leadership skills.

**Equip:**<br>
Training sessions are provided for the respective roles in order to equip them with the necessary technical skills and values to prepare them for their duties and responsibilities.

**Practice:**<br>
Platforms are provided for them in class, CCA, school events or beyond school for the students to exemplify their leadership skills. These platforms are planned intentionally for the various groups of student leaders in order for them to have opportunities to apply the skills learnt.
