<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>TK believes in giving every student an opportunity to be a leader. &nbsp;No
one is born with all the essential leadership qualities. Learning and developing
good leadership skills in a safe environment as a student leader would
serve our students well when they leave our learning environment and step
into the society.</p>
<p>As part of holistic education, at TK, leadership opportunities for our
students are guided by our school’s vision of ‘Passionate Learners, Caring
Leaders, Global Citizens’ and the school values of Perseverance, Respect,
Responsibility, Integrity, Discipline and Empathy. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The school has put in place a leadership structure to develop the leadership
competencies of our student leaders through three levels of leadership
dimensions of Lead Self, Lead Peers and Lead Teams and the Community.</p>
<h4>3-Tier Structure</h4>

</div>
<p>The Student Leadership structure in TK is 3-tiered and the first tier
refers to the Class Leaders. In this tier, students take up class leadership
positions where they focus on ‘Self Leadership’. TK strongly believes that
every student should be developed to be a leader and therefore such Student
Leadership Development is made intentional in TK. By the end of their Primary
school education, students would have achieved at least one tier of the
student leadership structure.</p>
<p>Students are trained to equip them with the necessary technical skills
and values to prepare them for their duties and responsibilities. These
training sessions also include case studies where the students analyze
the situations, share their thoughts and learn from one another. Following
the training, various platforms are provided for the class leaders to practice
their leadership skills. The Class Leadership Chart is displayed in the
classroom. This is to highlight the importance of the class leaders’ roles
and to empower them to perform their duties with diligence and confidence.</p>
<p>Our school uses a whole school approach in providing students with broad
experiences that develop leadership skills and qualities in them to care,
lead and inspire by continually conducting trainings at each level.</p>
<h4>Equip and Practice with TK Leadership Practices</h4>
<p>We aim to nurture Every Child A Leader through the 4 TK Leadership Practices
which we have adapted from the 5 Exemplary Leadership Practices by Kouzes
and Posner to undergird their Leadership Journey.</p>
<p>The Student Leadership programmes are intentionally planned with the two
tenets of ‘Equip’ and ‘Practice’ in mind. All students undergo leadership
training lessons to nurture the leadership potential of our student to
its fullest.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The learning materials and activities aim to explicitly and implicitly
impart leadership skills.</p>

<p><strong>Equip:</strong>
<br>Training sessions are provided for the respective roles in order to equip
them with the necessary technical skills and values to prepare them for
their duties and responsibilities.</p>
<p><strong>Practice:</strong>
<br>Platforms are provided for them in class, CCA, school events or beyond
school for the students to exemplify their leadership skills. These platforms
are planned intentionally for the various groups of student leaders in
order for them to have opportunities to apply the skills learnt.</p>
<h4>Student Leaders Council – Serve. Lead. Inspire</h4>

<p>At the end of P3, students will be nominated through the rating tools
by their form teachers for Student Leaders Council selection. Nominated
students will undergo a selection process by the Student Management Department
teachers to be shortlisted as student leaders in P4.</p>
<p><u>SLC- Service to the School</u>
</p>
<p>Student Leaders contribute to the school by ensuring the safety and discipline
of their peers. They are given the opportunities to help in school events
and activities to showcase their leadership skills and in leading their
peers.</p>
<p><u>SLC- Service to the Community</u>
</p>
<p><strong>Primary 4 and 5 SLC VIA Project</strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our student leaders embark on VIA projects to further expand their leadership
skills in leading and contributing to the Community. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Building on our school’s Applied Learning Programme on Developing Resilient
InnoVative Entrepreneurs, student leaders will apply Design Thinking framework
into their VIA projects. Through these projects, they experience and learn
the values R.E.S.P.E.C.T – Respect, Empathy, Sincerity, Patience, Ethical,
Compassionate and Teamwork. &nbsp; With the spirit of giving and empathy
in mind, we hope our student leaders will continue to Serve, Lead and Inspire
for years to come.</p>

<p><strong>Mentoring and Training</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>From Primary 4 to Primary 6, Student Leaders attend mentoring sessions
and a variety of workshops. During the mentoring sessions, using the 4
TK Practices, student leaders are actively engaged with multi-modal learning
materials that explore leadership values and traits. They collaboratively
grapple with ethical and moral case studies and seek solutions to them.
Students also undergo self-reflection to process and make meaning of the
learning experiences.</p>

<p>Through the leadership workshops, we aim to nurture the leadership potential
of our student leaders to their fullest. We hope to cultivate leaders who
possess competent leadership traits, sound moral qualities and social responsibility.
Additionally, student leaders are given opportunities to attend workshops
to equip them with good public speaking and team building skills. By the
end of primary school, student leaders emerge with an increased awareness
and confidence required for their student leadership roles.</p>
