### Our Tanjong Katong Primary Story - Tracing Our Roots & Heritage

#### Our History - At a Quick Glance

Tanjong Katong Primary (TKP) started in 2001 as an amalgamation of 3 schools, Fowlie Primary (a result of an earlier merger between Fowlie and Seraya Schools), Haig Boys’ and Mountbatten Primary Schools. In its earlier years, Tanjong Katong Primary was well-known for its higher proportion of international students. Even up till today, the school continues to boast of a student population that comes from diverse backgrounds in terms of their nationality and ethnicity. Since TKP opened its doors, it has made a name for itself with the all-round, balanced education it provides as well as the caring culture within the TKP community.

#### Seraya School

Seraya School was located on Seraya Road where Tanjong Katong Primary stands today. It had only one school block with three floors. It also shared a school field and dental clinic with a nearby school, Fowlie School. There was a big football field that separated Seraya School and Fowlie School. An imaginary line was drawn up on the shared field and students were not allowed to run across the ‘border’ especially during recess.

Due to low enrollment, both Seraya School and Fowlie School merged in 1986. The new school was named Fowlie Primary School.

#### Fowlie Primary School

Fowlie Primary School began life as Fowlie School at Fowlie Road. The road was named after Dr Peter Fowlie, a leading medical practitioner who later became the Municipal Commissioner in 1912.

When the school merged with Seraya School in 1986, the school was renamed Fowlie Primary School. In order to keep alive its link to Seraya School, the school had included Seraya’s flaming torch and four rings in its new badge.

#### Haig Boys’ School

Haig Boys’ School was founded on 10 September 1951. It was originally located at 25 Jalan Tembusu before it moved to 231 Mountbatten Road in 1988. The school took its name from Haig Road. The road was named after a high-ranking officer of the British Army, Douglas Haig (1861 - 1928).

To help the boys get close to nature, the school started the Eco-Garden in 1981. Everyone in the school, from the principal to the teachers, from the school attendants to the students, worked very hard to build the garden and they were all very proud of it. Parents also helped out by donating frogs, tortoises and plants.
