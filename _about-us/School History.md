### Our Tanjong Katong Primary Story - Tracing Our Roots & Heritage

#### Our History - At a Quick Glance

Tanjong Katong Primary (TKP) started in 2001 as an amalgamation of 3 schools, Fowlie Primary (a result of an earlier merger between Fowlie and Seraya Schools), Haig Boys’ and Mountbatten Primary Schools. In its earlier years, Tanjong Katong Primary was well-known for its higher proportion of international students. Even up till today, the school continues to boast of a student population that comes from diverse backgrounds in terms of their nationality and ethnicity. Since TKP opened its doors, it has made a name for itself with the all-round, balanced education it provides as well as the caring culture within the TKP community.

#### Seraya School

Seraya School was located on Seraya Road where Tanjong Katong Primary stands today. It had only one school block with three floors. It also shared a school field and dental clinic with a nearby school, Fowlie School. There was a big football field that separated Seraya School and Fowlie School. An imaginary line was drawn up on the shared field and students were not allowed to run across the ‘border’ especially during recess.

Due to low enrollment, both Seraya School and Fowlie School merged in 1986. The new school was named Fowlie Primary School.
