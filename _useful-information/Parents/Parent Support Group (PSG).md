The Parent Support Group at Tanjong Katong Primary is a vibrant group that fosters a collaborative environment for parents to engage with the school. The PSG plays a vital role in empowering parents to actively participate in our students’ educational journey. Together, TKP staff and parents work hand-in-hand to create a positive impact on the lives of our students, ensuring they receive the holistic support they need to flourish academically, emotionally, and socially.

**PURPOSE OF TKP PSG**
