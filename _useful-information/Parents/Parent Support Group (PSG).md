The Parent Support Group at Tanjong Katong Primary is a vibrant group that fosters a collaborative environment for parents to engage with the school. The PSG plays a vital role in empowering parents to actively participate in our students’ educational journey. Together, TKP staff and parents work hand-in-hand to create a positive impact on the lives of our students, ensuring they receive the holistic support they need to flourish academically, emotionally, and socially.

**PURPOSE OF TKP PSG**

TKP PSG collaborates with the school to create:

* a nurturing and educational environment to cultivate the students in all 6 domains of learning – Cognitive, Leadership, Aesthetics, Moral, Physical and Social (CLAMPS) channels of communications between school, family and community.
* a strong and sustainable Home-School partnership

**VISION**

Parents who serve with passion.

**MISSION**

To form a dynamic partnership with the school to nurture TKP students to become citizens of the world.
