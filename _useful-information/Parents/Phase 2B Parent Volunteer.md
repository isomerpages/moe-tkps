Tanjong Katong Primary School values its Parent Volunteers (PVs) and welcomes interested parents to apply to be a PV. In addition to enabling the successful PVs to qualify for priority registration under Phase 2B for the 2026 Primary 1 Registration Exercise, the programme seeks to foster long-term parental involvement in the school.    

You can register for the 2025 Phase 2B Parent Volunteer Scheme if your child is a Singapore Citizen or Singapore Permanent Resident born between 2 January 2020 and 1 January 2021 (both dates inclusive).   

The school will select PVs based on the school's needs and available vacancies. The selection decision is final and the school will not be able to provide reasons for unsuccessful applications.

For twins/triplets, please submit a fresh application for each child with the same parent's details. If a field is not applicable, please indicate "N.A.".     

Registration will begin on 28 March 2025 at 9.00am and end on 30 April 2025 at 11.59pm. Incomplete forms, late submissions or appeals will not be accepted.     

You will be notified via email by 30 May 2025 on the outcome of your application. All successful applicants will be required to attend a mandatory briefing, details of which will be shared at a later date.
