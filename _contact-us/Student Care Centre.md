Working parents today make up the majority of households and at afterschool, we seek to provide their children with quality care and curated experiences in a home-like environment. Children will experience an integrated activity schedule that blends well with their unique school’s values, developing them into sociable, resilient, confident and joyful individuals!

  

At afterschool, we believe the holistic development of your child continues after lessons end in school. Started by NTUC First Campus in 2016, we seek to provide working families with holistic, reliable and quality student care.

  

Based within the primary schools itself, we go beyond providing a continuum of care after school hours, we also develop our students through engaging experiences helping to develop them in becoming sociable, resilient, confident and joyful individuals. We accomplish this by balancing homework supervision together with providing curated programmes that complement each school’s mission, vision and values in a home-like environment.

  

With over 8 locations in various primary schools across Singapore, we are partners with parents and teachers in helping to develop children through an integrated learning experience throughout the school year.
