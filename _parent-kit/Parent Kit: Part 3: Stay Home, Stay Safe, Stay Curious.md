Dear parents,

  

As we enter the second week of Home-based Learning (HBL), you might still be adjusting and coming to grips with balancing working from home and supporting your children’s home-based learning. Let us all learn together and adapt to the new challenges that we are facing. Together, we can overcome them!

  

This issue of Parent Kit provides you with tips on how you can make the work from home experience more manageable and meaningful, while looking out for your child’s overall physical and cyber well-being during the HBL period.

  

Remember that we are only a few days into HBL. As the days go by, we will find our collective rhythm in setting up new norms for ourselves.

  

Let’s stay home, stay safe and stay curious. We will overcome the virus together.
