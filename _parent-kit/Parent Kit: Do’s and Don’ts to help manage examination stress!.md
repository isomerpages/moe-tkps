Dear parents,

  

Academic preparations are important but so is the mental wellbeing of you and your child. As one of their greatest cheerleaders, what are some things that you can do (and not do), to support your child as he/she focuses on preparing for their examinations, and to deal with the stress and manage expectations (both his/hers and yours)?

  

In this issue of Parent Kit, we provide you with practical tips to manage the examination stress, and invite you to hear from fellow parents how they support their children through examination periods.
