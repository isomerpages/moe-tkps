Dear parents,

  

A big thank you for the effort in supporting your children through Full Home-Based Learning. With the May holidays coming up, we hope this gives you an opportunity to find new ways to spend time and strengthen the bonds with your children while staying safe at home.

  

This issue of Parent Kit provides tips on how to occupy your child’s time meaningfully during this school holiday and how you can foster stronger relationships within the family.

  

Do also look out for a Holiday Care Pack that your child should have received from his/her teacher.

  

Let’s continue to do our part to fight the virus as we stay home, stay safe and stay curious this season!
