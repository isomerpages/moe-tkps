Dear parents,

  

Many of you would have observed your children becoming more independent through their HBL experience despite the initial challenges.

  

This has come about because of your efforts and commitment to provide a conducive home environment and establishing routines to allow them to take on greater responsibility.

  

As our children return to school, I encourage you not to let go of the good practices put in place. Instead, let’s ride on this momentum to support our children in being curious and developing a love for learning.

  

In this issue of Parent Kit, we offer you tips on how you can give your child space to learn and grow in confidence.

  

To encourage and motivate more parents to support their children to be independent, we would like to invite you to join the #MyIndependentLearner movement, to share and celebrate your efforts and our children’s growth!

  

Refer to Pg 9 and 10 to see how you can be a part of this.
