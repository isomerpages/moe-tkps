MOE Kindergarten @ Tanjong Katong will begin its operations in January 2024. 

At MOE Kindergarten, we believe that children are curious, active and competent learners.

Our vision is to provide a strong start for every child. We seek to do so through providing quality pre-school education that is affordable to Singaporeans and catalysing quality improvements in the sector.

Our curriculum is designed by MOE’s curriculum specialists, and is based on the Nurturing Early Learners Framework which guides the development of kindergarten programmes in Singapore. Your child will embark on an exciting learning journey at MOE Kindergarten through our two flagship programmes – the HI-Light Programme and the Starlight Literacy Programme.  The HI-Light Programme supports the holistic development of children through an integrated approach to learning. It ignites the joy of learning in children.  The Starlight Literacy Programme aims to nurture early childhood bilingualism. Offered in English and the three Mother Tongue Languages, the programme provides opportunities for children to enjoy English and their Mother Tongue Language, communicate with confidence and be aware of local traditions and customs.
