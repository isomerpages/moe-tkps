#### Gratitude to Our TKP Teachers - Post your Happy Teacher’s Day Wishes


_Calling all TKP Alumni!_

_Due to the safe management measures in place, we seek your kind understanding that our school will not be open to any ex-pupils on Teacher’s Day and anytime soon._

_Many of you would be very keen to convey your wishes to your teachers at TKP for this year’s Teacher’s Day! Don’t fret! We have created this platform for you to post your wishes on Padlet!_

_All the TKP teachers will be able to read your posts! Do note that Padlet is on the public domain._
