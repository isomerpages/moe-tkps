Tanjong Katong Primary School values its Parent Volunteers (PV's) and welcomes any interested parent to apply to be a PV. In addition to enabling the successful PV to qualify for priority registration under Phase 2B, the program seeks to foster long-term parental involvement in the school.
 
You can register your child in the 2023 Phase 2B Parent Volunteer Application if your child is a Singapore Citizen or Singapore Permanent Resident born between 2 January 2018 and 1 January 2019 (both dates inclusive).
 
Registration will begin on 30 Mar 2023 and end on 30 Apr 2023 at 11.59pm. Incomplete forms, late submissions or appeals will not be accepted. 
 
You will be notified via email on 15 May 2023 on the outcome of your application.
 
Please note that submission of the online application via FormSG does not mean acceptance as a Parent Volunteer by Tanjong Katong Primary School. We seek your understanding that the school will not be able to share with you the reasons for non-selection.
