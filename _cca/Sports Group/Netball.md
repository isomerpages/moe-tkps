<p>Netball is a popular sporting game for the girls in TKP. They learn the
basic knowledge, skills and attitudes in Netball. In the game, there are
seven players per team. Each player is given a "position" that defines
his/her responsibility and restricts their role to a specified area of
the court (roughly a third). The objective of the game is for teams to
pass a ball around and to shoot it into the goal ring to score goals.</p>
<p>The Developmental Team consists of players from P4 level. They learn the
fundamental skills needed in the game of Netball.</p>
<p>The Junior Team consists of players from P5 level. They revisit the fundamental
skills and learn about court strategies.</p>
<p>The Senior Team consists of players from P6 level. Increased knowledge
of court strategies are taught during this stage to increase their knowledge
of the game. These aim to increase players' decision making skills on and
off court.</p>
<h4>Objectives</h4>
<p>Through the comprehensive training programme for the different teams,
the CCA aims to develop students into thinking players and to reinforce
the school values of TK PR2IDE. The training program provides our netballers
with the relevant and necessary skills and knowledge to prepare them adequately
for life. It also teaches the players to work together, and improve their
social and verbal skills. It also helps to develop good hand-eye coordination,
depth perception, and reaction time.</p>
