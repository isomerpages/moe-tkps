<p>The Basketball Co-Curricular Activity (CCA) at TKP was established in
2022 and has quickly become a vibrant part of our school community. Under
the dedicated guidance of our teachers in charge—Ms. Rachel Wang, Mrs.
Jasmine Lim, Mdm. Aisyah Abu Bakar, and Ms. Sui Yang—our program has flourished.</p>
<p>This year, we are proud to celebrate our achievements: the Junior Boys
team secured 3rd place in Tier 1, while our first ever batch of Senior
Boys team claimed 1st place in League 5. These accomplishments reflect
the hard work and commitment of our players and coaches.</p>
