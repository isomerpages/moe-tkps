<p>The key objective of football in TKP is to develop the love and interest
of the sport in our students. It is also our key goal to help students
to maximise their full potential and equip students with skills to do their
best in any competitions.</p>
<p>Our competitive squads are provided with opportunities to play against
other schools in hopes to gain valuable experiences and team bonding. We
believe that competing in football teaches the students more than the rules
of play; it provides one with tools that translate into other aspects of
their life.</p>
<p>For our recreational squads, we aim to create a respectful, positive and
healthy environment for our students to improve their individual technical
skills, physical conditioning as well as to improve their understanding
and appreciation of team play.</p>
<p>Through the guidance expertise of our dedicated and experienced coaches
and teachers. We not only focus on developing and honing the technical
skills of our players, such as dribbling, passing and tackling, but also
to develop them into responsible self-leaders and an active contributors
to the society. Other values such as commitment, perseverance, confidence,
respect and camaraderie are inculcated in the students to develop them
to not just be competent players but better individuals.</p>
