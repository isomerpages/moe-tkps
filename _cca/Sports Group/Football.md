The key objective of football in TKP is to develop the love and interest of the sport in our students. It is also our key goal to help students to maximise their full potential and equip students with skills to do their best in any competitions.

  

Our competitive squads are provided with opportunities to play against other schools in hopes to gain valuable experiences and team bonding. We believe that competing in football teaches the students more than the rules of play; it provides one with tools that translate into other aspects of their life.

  

For our recreational squads, we aim to create a respectful, positive and healthy environment for our students to improve their individual technical skills, physical conditioning as well as to improve their understanding and appreciation of team play.

  

Through the guidance expertise of our dedicated and experienced coaches and teachers. We not only focus on developing and honing the technical skills of our players, such as dribbling, passing and tackling, but also to develop them into responsible self-leaders and an active contributors to the society. Other values such as commitment, perseverance, confidence, respect and camaraderie are inculcated in the students to develop them to not just be competent players but better individuals.
