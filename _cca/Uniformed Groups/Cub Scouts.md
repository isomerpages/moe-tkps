### Programme Style

The major feature of the Cub Scouts program is that it helps its members to build character and leadership. Scouting provides an informal education to develop individuals for purposeful and responsible adulthood, always prepared to serve God, country and humanity.

  

The Scouting Method encourages a cub scout to be a self-reliant, supportive and committed person, who is actively involved in activities and be responsible for their own development.

  

The Scouting Method also encourages the holistic physical, mental, spiritual and social development with a strong emphasis on duty to country and helping other people. It is based on a value system grounded on spiritual, social and personal principles as expressed in the Promise and Law.

  

Outdoor-oriented activities, such as campfire and camp craft skill, bring the cub scouts close to Nature.

  

  

### **Types of Activities**

Cub Scouts activities involve playing games of every sort to ensure a balanced training approach. Stories, in particular Kipling’s Jungle Book and other similar stories that involve adventure, romance, humour, history, religious stories etc., are used and help each Cub Scout to more easily understand the meaning of their Promise and Law through analogy, stories and plays. Songs singing and hands-on activities such as hiking, outdoor camp cooking and tents pitching are important to help children use their fingers and their heads to work collaboratively with their peers.  

  

  

### Progress Awards

Starting from this early development stages, Cub Scouts will aim to earn a series of Badges, which give them a knowledge of basic Scouting skills and mark achievements in areas such as camp craft, air and water activities, citizenship and improving the environment.

  

The Cub Scouts Section Training Scheme is divided into 3 progress badges and a highest award:

> *   Bronze Arrow
> *   Silver Arrow
> *   Gold Arrow
> *   Akela Award

Each progress badge comprises tests for Citizenship, Leadership and Responsibility, Physical Skills, Self-Reliance, Adventure and Fun.

  

The highest award in this section is the Akela Award, where a Cub Scout must hold the Gold Arrow and pass specific proficiency badges, show general knowledge of scouting and successfully complete an interview with the District Commissioner.

Objectives
----------

*   A group environment which is intellectually stimulating, physically vital and directed towards satisfying the child’s basic need to face and overcome challenges
*   Self-developmental activities as vital components of the overall drive towards encouraging “Fun & Discovery” amongst the Cubs
*   Group activities that are based on the natural sense of fun and enthusiasm of the age group and thus the training is achieved largely through games, interaction in small groups and activities
