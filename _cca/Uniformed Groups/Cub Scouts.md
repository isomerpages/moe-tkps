<h5>Programme Style</h5>
<p>The Cub Scouts experience encourages the holistic physical, mental, spiritual
and social development with a strong emphasis on duty to country and helping
other people.</p>
<p>Outdoor-oriented activities, such as orienteering, hiking, campfire, outdoor
camp cooking and tents pitching, help to build character and leadership.</p>
<p>Songs singing and playing team-based games also ensure a balanced experience
where they work collaboratively with their peers.</p>
<h5><strong>Types of Activities</strong></h5>
<p>Cub Scouts activities involve playing games of every sort to ensure a
balanced training approach. Stories, in particular Kipling’s Jungle Book
and other similar stories that involve adventure, romance, humour, history,
religious stories etc., are used and help each Cub Scout to more easily
understand the meaning of their Promise and Law through analogy, stories
and plays. Songs singing and hands-on activities such as hiking, outdoor
camp cooking and tents pitching are important to help children use their
fingers and their heads to work collaboratively with their peers.</p>
<h5>Progress Awards</h5>
<p>Starting from this early development stages, Cub Scouts will aim to earn
a series of Badges, which give them a knowledge of basic Scouting skills
and mark achievements in areas such as camp craft, air and water activities,
citizenship and improving the environment.</p>
<p>The Cub Scouts Section Training Scheme is divided into 3 progress badges
and a highest award:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Bronze Arrow</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Silver Arrow</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gold Arrow</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Akela Award</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Each progress badge comprises tests for Citizenship, Leadership and Responsibility,
Physical Skills, Self-Reliance, Adventure and Fun.</p>
<p>The highest award in this section is the Akela Award, where a Cub Scout
must hold the Gold Arrow and pass specific proficiency badges, show general
knowledge of scouting and successfully complete an interview with the District
Commissioner.</p>
<h4>Objectives</h4>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>A group environment which is intellectually stimulating, physically vital
and directed towards satisfying the child’s innate need to face and overcome
challenges.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Self-developmental activities as vital components of the overall drive
towards encouraging “Fun &amp; Discovery” amongst the Cubs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Group activities that are based on the natural sense of fun and enthusiasm
of the age group. Thus the experience is achieved largely through games,
interaction in small groups and activities.</p>
</li>
</ol>
