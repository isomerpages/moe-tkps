<p>The TKP choir is a group of students who enjoy singing and sharing their
love of music together. During practices, the members work hard to improve
their vocal techniques with our instructors. The choir repertoire ranges
from classical to contemporary pieces, with songs in various languages
such as Japanese and Hungarian.</p>
<p>Our choir had the opportunity to perform for various internal school celebrations,
as well as external performances such as the Mountbatten GRC National Day
Celebration. With these experiences, we hope to further develop the vocal
talents of the members of the choir and share their joy of singing with
the community.</p>
