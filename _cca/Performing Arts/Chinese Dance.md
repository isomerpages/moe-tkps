<p>The Chinese dance CCA group has always been a popular CCA&nbsp;choice
for the students who are attracted by various opportunities to perform
and compete, not forgetting the graceful dance choreography and beautiful
costumes. After joining the CCA, members learn that a lot of hard work
is involved behind that glam on stage. They train for hours in order to
perfect routines and in the process, beautiful friendships are forged.
TKP Chinese Dance are also frequently invited to external community events
such as Marine Parade Cluster&nbsp; Chinese New Year Celebration, Mountbatten
GRC National Day Celebration, Esplanade events and school events such as
Prize-Giving ceremony, Chinese New Year and International Friendship Day
celebrations. The Chinese dance CCA has also been taking part in Singapore
Youth Festival International Dance biennially and achieved wonderful results,
with the most recent 2024 Singapore Youth Festival, achieving Certificate
of Distinction.</p>
