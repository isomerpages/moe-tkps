<p>TK Malay Dance Club CCA has been around for many years and comprises about
20 students from Primary 3 to Primary 6 girls and boys. The CCA offers
the students an exciting array of Malay dance skills and techniques that
are both traditional and contemporary that push the boundaries of creativity
and modernity.</p>
<p>In order to create a community of students who are able to appreciate
the different forms of dance, students are taught and exposed to basic
understanding of the different types of Malay Culture like asli, inang,
zapin and masri when they join the club. To keep up with time, other dance
genre such as silat and contemporary Malay dance will also be introduced
to widen studentsâ€™ knowledge.</p>
<p>TK Malay Dance Club has performed commendably well in all its participation
in the Singapore Youth Festival that takes place biennially. Due to their
outstanding performance, the Club was honoured when they were invited to
perform and display their talents in external events such as SYF Celebration
in the Community at Bukit Panjang Plaza in 2019. In school, they also performed
for events such as Racial Harmony Day and Prize Giving Day.</p>
