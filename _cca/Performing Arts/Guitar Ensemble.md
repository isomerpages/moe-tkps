-------------------------------------------

Founded in 2016, the guitar ensemble started with about less than 10 members in the CCA. Over the next few years, its membership grew to 41 strong.

  

Students from as young as the P3s were talent scouted and invited to join the CCA when they are in P4. Under the guidance of the instructors from Music Global Impact, Miss Angeline Wee, Mr Terence and others, the members were groomed in their guitar playing skills. As the students hone their skills, they also learn to cultivate school values such as perseverance, responsibilities and others.

  

As a result, Guitar Ensemble managed to clinch the SYF Certificate of Accomplishment for two consecutive SYF years. Another noteworthy mention, every year, our students participate in the Annual Guitar Festivals organised by Music Global Impact and they were the youngest performers performing together with secondary schools and JC students. Apart from this, they have also been invited to perform at National Day Celebrations organised by Mountbatten Community Centre. To further ignite their passion and to inspire them in playing the guitar, the students watched a concert performance by professional guitar ensemble group in 2019.
