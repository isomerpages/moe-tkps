<p>Founded in 2016, the guitar ensemble started with about less than 10 members
in the CCA. Over the next few years, its membership grew to 41 strong.</p>
<p>Students from as young as the P3s were talent scouted and invited to join
the CCA when they are in P4. Under the guidance of the instructors from
Music Global Impact, Miss Angeline Wee, Mr Terence and others, the members
were groomed in their guitar playing skills. As the students hone their
skills, they also learn to cultivate school values such as perseverance,
responsibilities and others.</p>
<p>As a result, Guitar Ensemble managed to clinch the SYF Certificate of
Accomplishment for two consecutive SYF years. Another noteworthy mention,
every year, our students participate in the Annual Guitar Festivals organised
by Music Global Impact and they were the youngest performers performing
together with secondary schools and JC students. Apart from this, they
have also been invited to perform at National Day Celebrations organised
by Mountbatten Community Centre. To further ignite their passion and to
inspire them in playing the guitar, the students watched a concert performance
by professional guitar ensemble group in 2019.</p>
